        <h4>WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">This Privacy Policy of the Smit Foundation (“Ngo”) covers the collection, use,
          and
          disclosure of personal information that may be collected by the Ngo when you interact with the Ngo, such as
          when
          you visit our web site, when you input information into our web site online, or when you call our sales or
          support
          associates. Please take a moment to carefully read the following to learn more about our information
          practices,
          including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we
          disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at the
          Ngo,
          and we go to great lengths to protect it.</p> <b>Reasons the Ngo Collects Personal Information</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level
          of
          service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our services and focus on categories of greatest
          interest
          to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest Ngo announcements and
          events
          that you might like to hear about.<br><br> If you do not want the Ngo to keep you up to date with our news and
          the
          latest information on products and services please email <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html"
            class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5e3d31302a3f3d2a1e3f2e2b2d3f70312c39">[email&#160;protected]</a> to
          inquire about and/or update your
          personal contact information and preferences.</p> <b>Information the Ngo Collects and How the Information May
          be
          Used</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">There are a number of situations in which your personal information may
          help us give you better products. For example: We may ask for your personal information when you inquire about
          the
          Smit Foundation, donations thereto, and other ways to get involved.<br><br> When you interact with the Ngo, we
          may
          collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number,
          email
          address, and contact preferences; and information relating to a support or service issue.<br><br> We collect
          information regarding user activities on our web sites. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful
          information to users and to understand which parts of our web sites, products, and Internet services are of
          most
          interest to them.<br><br> This information may be shared with third parties or in special circumstances as
          described elsewhere in this policy.</p> <b>When the Ngo Discloses Your Information</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The Ngo takes your privacy very seriously. The Ngo does not sell or rent your
          contact
          information to marketers or any third-party.<br><br> To help us provide superior service, your personal
          information may be shared with entities within our Foundation globally who will take steps to safeguard it in
          accordance with our privacy policy.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">There are also times when it may be
          advantageous for the Ngo to make certain personal information about you available to companies that the Ngo
          has a
          strategic relationship with or that perform work for the Ngo to provide services to you on our behalf. These
          companies may help us process information, donations and perform general Foundation research. In such
          situation
          these companies are prohibited from using your personal information for any unauthorized purposes and are also
          obligated to protect your information in accordance with the Ngo’s policies, except if we inform you otherwise
          at
          the time of collection. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for us to serve
          our
          purpose, and to collect donations in a straightforward and secure manner.<br><br> We also reserve the right to
          disclose your personal information for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable
          to
          do so, including credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, litigation
          or
          to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations,
          or
          governmental or legal requests for such information. We may also disclose personal information that is
          necessary
          to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our contracts, policies and
          procedures. Finally we may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law
          enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.</p> <b>How the Ngo Protects Your
          Personal Information</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The Ngo takes precautions—including administrative,
          technical, and physical measures—to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as
          well
          as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.<br><br> While we make every effort to ensure
          the
          integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
          third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining your personal information.</p> <b>Integrity of Your Personal
          Information</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The Ngo has safeguards in place to keep your personal information
          accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used. You always have the right to access
          and
          correct the personal information you have provided and can help us ensure that your contact information and
          preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by emailing <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html"
            class="__cf_email__"
            data-cfemail="4a23242c250a3927233e2c253f242e2b3e2325246425382d64">[email&#160;protected]</a></p> <b>Privacy
          of
          Children</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us. The Ngo
          recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase our products for family use, including use
          by
          minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but
          because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the Ngo
          purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits
          personal
          information to the Ngo and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we
          will
          attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. It is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online
          Privacy Protection Act of 2013 and all other applicable laws.</p> <b>Cookies and Other Technologies</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">As is standard practice on many corporate web sites, our web site uses “cookies”
          and
          other technologies to help us understand which parts of our web sites are the most popular, where our visitors
          are
          going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our
          online
          advertising is bringing customers to our products and services. We use cookies and other technologies to study
          traffic patterns on our web site, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our
          customer communications. And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each
          time
          you interact with us.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies, please go
          to [web site address], which explains step by step how you can disable cookies. Please note that certain
          features
          of our web site will not be available once cookies are disabled.<br><br> As is true of most web sites, we
          gather
          certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP)
          addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
          stamp,
          and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to
          administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our
          user base as a whole. The Ngo will not use the information collected to market directly to that
          person.<br><br> In
          some of our email messages we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our web site. When customers
          click
          one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this
          click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our
          customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the
          email.<br><br> In addition we use pixel tags—tiny graphic images—to tell us what parts of our web site
          customers
          have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable
          us
          to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to
          ensure
          that we’re sending only messages that are of interest to our customers. We may use this information to reduce
          or
          eliminate messages sent to a customer. We store all of this information in a secure database located in
          [location]
          in the United States.</p> <b>Commitment to Your Privacy</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">As we said, the Ngo
          takes protecting your privacy very seriously. To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate
          these guidelines to our employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the Ngo. In addition, the Ngo
          supports industry initiatives, such as TRUSTe, to preserve privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects
          of
          electronic commerce.</p> <b>International Users</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The Ngo abides by the safe
          harbor framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
          personal information collected from the European Union.</p> <b>Links to Sites of Other Companies</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Our web site has links to the sites of other companies. We are not responsible
          for
          their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.</p>
        <b>Further
          Questions Regarding Privacy</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">If you have questions or concerns about the Ngo’s
          Customer Privacy Policy or data processing, please use the appropriate regional email addresses (see list
          below)
          to contact us. The Ngo’s Data Controller in your region will respond to your inquiry within 30 days.</p>

        </p> <b>Effective
          Date; Updates to Privacy Policy</b>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The terms and conditions in this policy
          statement came into effect on August 9, 2018. The Ngo reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this
          policy
          at any time and in any manner. When we change the policy in a material way a notice will be posted on our web
          site
          along with the updated privacy policy. Your use of our web site and any other services provided by the Ngo
          after
          such changes are implemented constitutes your acknowledgement and acceptance of these changes. Please consult
          this
          privacy statement prior to every use for any changes.</p>
